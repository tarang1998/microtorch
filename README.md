# microtorch

A minimal neural network and autograd engine inspired by PyTorch, implemented in pure Python.

## Features
- Scalar-based autograd engine (`Value` class)
- Support for basic operations and activation functions (ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, exp)
- Modular neural network components: Neuron, Layer, MLP
